                <p>Description:<br />
                    I'm interested in producing a series of texts describing multiple "sets" or "motifs" which respond to two key reference points: media theorist Niklas Luhmann's concept of ordered observation as it permeates from mass media systems, and Snell's Window, a concept within physical optics derived by mathematician Willebrord Snellius and used to describe the appearance an underwater viewer experiences of the surface above. I'm using these to reference points to interface with my personal relationship with image making, having worked professionally as a qualifier of images in an academic and technical context, against the rising tide of artificially produced imagery. The text pieces I produce will likely serve more accurately as "scripts" or "prompts" to borrow language from the context of increasingly technological production of imagery. I see an interesting development in the replacing of technical precision with verbal attunement as they relate to visual fidelity. I'm interested in how these scripts can then appropriate and adapt methodologies more commonplace within an exhibition format.</p>

                <p>Description:<br />
                I'm currently writing about my epxerience that has unfolded over the last 10 years, of uploading a shitpost video to YouTube, that later became a meme affording me millions of views and tens of thousands of subscribers, and later came to be sampled on a Kanye West album. The orignal video was found/appropriated, so the ensuing consequences were separate from my own merit. The experience as a whole needs to be examined for concerns about authorship and an evaluation of the flow of media online, a foundation for a larger discussion cultural output and valuation.</p>

                Four detail photographs of a show, fully comprised of 11 framed prints and one poem. The prints were produced using a found 35mm projection film reel of the 30 second trailer for the film, <em>Arctic Tale</em> (2009). Still frames of film were separated and enlarged in the darkroom, converting them into negative black and white prints. These black and white paper negatives were used again to produce contact-printed positive prints. The final series includes still frames of trailer footage and inter-title text.</p>

                <br />2023</p> 
            <p>Part of exhibition with Steve Kado at Soldes, Los Angeles, April-May 2023</p>
            <p>Text by Steve Kado:<br />At the heart of Sean Lockwood's Student Work Accompanied by Poster (2023) there is an agreement. The agreement is between Sean Lockwood and Steve Kado, wherein a recently acquired cloud atlas in poster-form (Clouds: A Guide To The Sky, 2023) must be shown as a condition of exhibiting Lockwood's video from 2016, NOTAM of Wind.<br /><br />The agreement exists because NOTAM of Wind, inspired by a hot air balloon simulator video game1, was made in an art school context — itself a weird simulation of the reality of working and living as an artist. Lockwood felt that it would only make sense to show the video with some kind of acknowledgment of how different the context was from then to now. The work was made suspended between the poles of antipathy towards 'making sculpture' out of metal or wood and fascination with 'ambient' or 'non-inflammatory' images like hot air balloons, rainbows and the like.<br /><br />The "non-inflammatory image” or “ambient image” remains at the core of both the video and the agreement. An ambient image is a picture that exists to show that pictures exist, placeholder or default images, pictures with a wide variety of colors and almost nothing personal or individual — a semiotic dead end. For a time, the hot air balloon was the ruler of this image kingdom. So ingrained was its use that imaging software company Corel used a hot air balloon on all their marketing and ad copy starting in the 80s because no other image could be all images and none more than a hot air balloon.<br /><br />Perhaps the opposite of the ambient, non-inflammatory image is not the hyper-meaningful, charged and powerful image but the exemplary image, the draft animal of images, images that explain specific useful things: what to do if someone is choking, what plants are poisonous, what to watch out for when observing the weather. Based on the clouds, will it be safe to go up in the hot air balloon?<br /><br />The placeholder image is changing: there now exists enough easily searchable stock photography that one can always be more precise in who and for what an image is to be used. There are so many images that now everyone can have their own. As such, the image of the hot air balloon is changing from something pleasant, colorful but unremarkable into something that is now gnomic, a gem produced by the great forces unleashed within the volcano of images that has been our 21st century so far.<br /><br />1 NOTAM of Wind is itself named after a Japanese hot air balloon simulator game for PlayStation1 made by a company with the unlikely but remarkable name ArtDink.</p>

                <br />Language follows clothing. Proper marketing technique dictates to us that products cannot
                simply exist and be bought—they must also be described. In any commercial context a step of
                knowing precedes purchasing. In an e-commerce context webpages should be filled appropriately
                with text here and there to function in the same way as dressing a boutique, stretching to ends of
                a rectangle as need be. Describing options or variations or suggested pairings or identifying
                solutions to identified problems requires some form of copy writing or numeric/non-numeric
                sizing information or color or short or long or style in order to describe the product. During my
                residency I was able to witness the tools, specifically computer keyboards, used for creating that
                description.<br /><br />
                I've been really into typing games for some time now. I feel like a lot of people associate them
                with being young in school and learning touch-typing while being told how much of an essential
                skill it will be. I think it has mostly helped me with messaging comfortably. I like thinking about
                them more now because of how much they also feel like work simulators. Typing games
                typically consist of transcribing prescribed passages of text, and the game becomes a matter of
                copying these passages. Time management also plays a role because there are usually time
                constraints motivating you to finishing your copying quickly. All of the elements of industrial
                labor—repetition, accuracy, speed, etc. can be very straightforwardly encapsulated into a game to
                more or less pass time or feel busy. Games like these can also be an effective gauge for
                understanding storage solutions. Because the basic mechanic of any typing game hasn't ever
                needed to change, the same idea can be repackaged over and over again (maybe with slight
                variations on a theme) as new products. Every update in readable media formats occurring over
                the last few decades has shown that these kinds of products can be re-shoveled on to whatever
                tech, never questioning how much longer typing will be necessary. Only now as we see them
                disappearing from laptops do we see mechanical keyboards getting the final push into the tech
                fetish category of quirky peripherals. Their continued survival is an in-house chore, left to the
                domain of appliances whose design integrity will outlast them. Dishwashers can easily clean dust
                and food crumbs out of keyboards in one cycle.<br /><br />
                At Prairie Underground, a once operational sauna fell victim to an illicit supply/demand chain
                concerning copper one night, rendering it defunct of its original use and relegating it to a storage
                closet. Since both a dishwasher and a sauna are on site, and because they both heat water to the
                same temperature when they're working, I wanted to introduce employee keyboards to them. So I
                went to the building at night, when I knew no one would be at work the next day, and removed
                employee keyboards from their work stations so that they could spend the following night, of the
                opening reception, in the sauna.<br /><br />
                The playlist I made is for listening to while playing typing games. The music I chose to include
                in the playlist all comes from other video game soundtracks and is all composed by video game
                music composers. I tried to encapsulate the energy required to type fast and accurately in the
                tracks I selected. I eventually burned discs with the music playlist on it. For this I was mostly
                inspired by the backup of Prairie Underground Operations & Maintenance Manual to a CD.
                Some copies of the disc were given to customers as a lagniappe.
